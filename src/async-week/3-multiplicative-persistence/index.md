Without using coercion: modulus we use modulus to extract every digit from a number and find the product. For instance, `237` will follow `7*1, 7*3, 21*2 = 42`

**Helper Function**

Merely returns the product of the digit. Extracted 7 lines from the iterative approach.

A one-liner ðŸ™ƒ (with a helper function!)
